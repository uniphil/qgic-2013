        <h2>About QGIC</h2>
        <p>The Queen’s Global Innovation Conference, or QGIC, inspires attendees to care about the most pressing global issues of our time (think climate change, poverty, and overpopulation), to innovate solutions to these problems, and to integrate them into their communities.  We believe that the challenges we face are increasingly complex and interconnected and require an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> approach. That’s why we are aiming to be the most interdisciplinary conference on campus. You should leave the conference as a smart <strong>systems-changer</strong>, equipped with the necessary tools to create positive change and knowing where they can have the greatest impact</p>

        <h3>Our Vision &mdash; The Power to Change systems</h3>
        <p>We believe that addressing complex global issues will require a different approach than the one we’ve been using.</p>

        <h3>Here’s what we’re doing differently:</h3>

        <div class="doing collabs">
          <h4 class="big">Collaborative Innovation</h4>
          <blockquote>
            For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong
            <cite>H. L. Mencken</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>No one person holds the solution. Solutions will come from the experiences, insights and creativity of a group of individuals working together toward a common goal. Solutions will require coordination across industries, disciplines, and silos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doing systems">
          <h4 class="big">Systems Thinking</h4>
          <blockquote>
            We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.
            <cite>Donella H. Meadows</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The challenges we face are increasingly complex and interconnected. Complexity is the nature of living systems and the world we live in. Systems thinking teaches us to work within a system’s constraints to achieve desired results and avoid unintended consequences. It stresses the role of interconnections, including the role we play within the system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doing leaders">
          <h4 class="big">Leadership</h4>
          <blockquote>
            Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.
            <cite>Margaret Mead</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Delegates should leave the conference feeling empowered to take action, and equipped with the necessary tools to accomplish their goals. We want to challenge delegates to ask questions about themselves and the systems they operate within, and to be leaders in their communities.</p>
